Subject: [PATCH] x86/cpuid: Fix HLE and RTM handling (again)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

For reasons which are my fault, but I don't recall why, the
FDP_EXCP_ONLY/NO_FPU_SEL adjustment uses the whole special_features[] array
element, not the two relevant bits.

HLE and RTM were recently added to the list of special features, causing them
to be always set in guest view, irrespective of the toolstacks choice on the
matter.

Rewrite the logic to refer to the features specifically, rather than relying
on the contents of the special_features[] array.

Fixes: 8fe24090d9 ("x86/cpuid: Rework HLE and RTM handling")
