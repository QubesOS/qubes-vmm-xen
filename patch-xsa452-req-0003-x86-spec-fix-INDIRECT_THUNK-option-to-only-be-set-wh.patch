Subject: [PATCH 3/5] x86/spec: fix INDIRECT_THUNK option to only be set when
 build-enabled
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Attempt to provide a more helpful error message when the user attempts to set
spec-ctrl=bti-thunk option but the support is build-time disabled.

While there also adjust the command line documentation to mention
CONFIG_INDIRECT_THUNK instead of INDIRECT_THUNK.

 On hardware supporting IBRS (Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation), the
 `ibrs=` option can be used to force or prevent Xen using the feature itself.
