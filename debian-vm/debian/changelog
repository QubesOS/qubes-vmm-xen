xen (4.11.1~pre+1.733450b39b-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Completely overhauled the packaging.  In the source package, things
    are very much simpler now with only a few hundred loc of templating
    and scriptery.  In the binary packages the resulting changes are:
     - We now provide -dbgsym packages in the standard way
      - Shared libraries with unstable ABI upstream (ie, whose
        ABI changes with the Xen version) are now in
        libxen<version>-misc rather than libxen<version> and
        have more conventional-looking filenames.
     - Shared libraries with a stable ABI upstream are now each in their
       own package, named after the soname (ABI version), as is
       conventional.  The sonames and minor versions of these are
       no longer mangled.
     - xs.h, replaced upstream by xenstore.h, is now in
       /usr/include/xenstore-compat (as shipped upstream), with
       symlinks left behind.
     - fsimage*.h is no longer shipped (it's namespace-grabbish).
     - libxenvchan.h is in /usr/include as it is in upstream,
       not buried in /usr/include/xen/io
     - /etc/xen/cpupool, a not very interesting example config file,
       has been moved into /usr/share/doc/.
     - There is a new xen-doc package, in which the upstream HTML
       documentation, and various other bits, is now provided.  This
       replaces the text format documentation previously provided in
       xen-utils-common (but the manpages are still there).
     - Utilities which use on libraries with stable ABIs upstream
       are no longer subjected to the Xen version wrapper.
     - Several utilities are now provided in /usr/bin which were
       previously only available buried in /usr/lib/xen-<version>:
          xen-detect xenalyze xencons xencov_split xen-cpuid
       (version-wrapped, where necessary).
     - Likewise very many utilities and daemons in /usr/sbin:
          gdbsx xen-bugtool xen-ringwatch xen-tmem-list-parse
          xenmon xenpmd flask-* xen-kdd xen-diag xen-hptool
          xen-hvmcrash xen-hvmctx xen-livepatch xen-lowmemd
          xen-mfndump xenbaked xenconsoled xencov xenlockprof
          xenstored xenwatchdogd
     - xend and xm are long gone, so remove the support for the
       TOOLSTACK setting in /etc/default/xen.  /usr/sbin/xen just
       runs xl now.  Remove mentions of xend-config.sxp and all
       *.sxp files.  Drop the xend init script.
     - There is no longer any Built-Using.  This is no longer true for
       seabios, which is depended on and used at runtime, rather than
       being embedded into hvmloader.  (The source package also previously
       tried to mention ipxe-qemu in Built-Using but that's (i) dependent
       upstream on CONFIG_ROMBIOS which we disable, and not a
       build-dependency either.)
     - The hvmloader and xen-shim binaries no longer have their .note
       and .comment section(s) stripped.  .note is needed for xen-shim
       to work properly and to find the corresponding debug files.
       And .comment is tiny and harmless AFAICT.
     - Hypervisor debug map files are installed in /usr/lib/debug.
     - The xl bash_completion file from upstream is installed.
     - libxenvchan.h is installed.
     - We install xen-*.efi in /boot.
     - Sections of some packages have been rationalised.
     - We install a doc-base control file.
