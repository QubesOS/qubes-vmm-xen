Subject: [PATCH] x86/tsx: Deprecate vpmu=rtm-abort and use tsx=<bool> instead
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This reuses the rtm_disable infrastructure, so CPUID derivation works properly
when TSX is disabled in favour of working PCR3.

vpmu= is not a supported feature, and having this functionality under tsx=
centralises all TSX handling.
