Subject: [PATCH 01/10] x86/AMD: extend Zenbleed check to models "good" ucode
 isn't known for

Reportedly the AMD Custom APU 0405 found on SteamDeck, models 0x90 and
0x91, (quoting the respective Linux commit) is similarly affected. Put
another instance of our Zen1 vs Zen2 distinction checks in
amd_check_zenbleed(), forcing use of the chickenbit irrespective of
ucode version (building upon real hardware never surfacing a version of
0xffffffff).
