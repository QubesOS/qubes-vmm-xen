Subject: [PATCH 4/5] x86/spec: do not print thunk option selection if not
 built-in
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Since the thunk built-in enable is printed as part of the "Compiled-in
support:" line, avoid printing anything in "Xen settings:" if the thunk is
disabled at build time.

Note the BTI-Thunk option printing is also adjusted to print a colon in the
same way the other options on the line do.
