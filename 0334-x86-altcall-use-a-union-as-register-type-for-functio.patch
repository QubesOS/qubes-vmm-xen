Subject: [PATCH 334/349] x86/altcall: use a union as register type for
 function parameters on clang
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The current code for alternative calls uses the caller parameter types as the
types for the register variables that serve as function parameters:

uint8_t foo;
[...]
alternative_call(myfunc, foo);

Would expand roughly into:

register unint8_t a1_ asm("rdi") = foo;
register unsigned long a2_ asm("rsi");
[...]
asm volatile ("call *%c[addr](%%rip)"...);

However with -O2 clang will generate incorrect code, given the following
example:

unsigned int func(uint8_t t)
{
    return t;
}

static void bar(uint8_t b)
{
    int ret_;
    register uint8_t di asm("rdi") = b;
    register unsigned long si asm("rsi");
    register unsigned long dx asm("rdx");
    register unsigned long cx asm("rcx");
    register unsigned long r8 asm("r8");
    register unsigned long r9 asm("r9");
    register unsigned long r10 asm("r10");
    register unsigned long r11 asm("r11");

    asm volatile ( "call %c[addr]"
                   : "+r" (di), "=r" (si), "=r" (dx),
                     "=r" (cx), "=r" (r8), "=r" (r9),
                     "=r" (r10), "=r" (r11), "=a" (ret_)
                   : [addr] "i" (&(func)), "g" (func)
                   : "memory" );
}

void foo(unsigned int a)
{
    bar(a);
}

Clang generates the following assembly code:

func:                                   # @func
        movl    %edi, %eax
        retq
foo:                                    # @foo
        callq   func
        retq

Note the truncation of the unsigned int parameter 'a' of foo() to uint8_t when
passed into bar() is lost.  clang doesn't zero extend the parameters in the
callee when required, as the psABI mandates.

The above can be worked around by using a union when defining the register
variables, so that `di` becomes:

register union {
    uint8_t e;
    unsigned long r;
} di asm("rdi") = { .e = b };

Which results in following code generated for `foo()`:

foo:                                    # @foo
        movzbl  %dil, %edi
        callq   func
        retq

So the truncation is not longer lost.  Apply such workaround only when built
with clang.
