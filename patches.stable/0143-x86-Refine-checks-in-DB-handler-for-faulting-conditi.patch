Subject: x86: Refine checks in #DB handler for faulting
 conditions

One of the fix for XSA-260 (c/s 75d6828bc2 "x86/traps: Fix handling of #DB
exceptions in hypervisor context") added some safety checks to help avoid
livelocks of #DB faults.

While a General Detect #DB exception does have fault semantics, hardware
clears %dr7.gd on entry to the handler, meaning that it is actually safe to
return to.  Furthermore, %dr6.gd is guest controlled and sticky (never cleared
by hardware).  A malicious PV guest can therefore trigger the fatal_trap() and
crash Xen.

Instruction breakpoints are more tricky.  The breakpoint match bits in %dr6
are not sticky, but the Intel manual warns that they may be set for
non-enabled breakpoints, so add a breakpoint enabled check.

Beyond that, because of the restriction on the linear addresses PV guests can
set, and the fault (rather than trap) nature of instruction breakpoints
(i.e. can't be deferred by a MovSS shadow), there should be no way to
encounter an instruction breakpoint in Xen context.  However, for extra
robustness, deal with this situation by clearing the breakpoint configuration,
rather than crashing.

This is XSA-265
