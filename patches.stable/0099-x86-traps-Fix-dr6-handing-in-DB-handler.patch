Subject: x86/traps: Fix %dr6 handing in #DB handler

Most bits in %dr6 accumulate, rather than being set directly based on the
current source of #DB.  Have the handler follow the manuals guidance, which
avoids leaking hypervisor debugging activities into guest context.

This is part of XSA-260 / CVE-2018-8897.
