Subject: [PATCH] libxl: do not fail device removal if backend domain is gone
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Backend domain may be independently destroyed - there is no
synchronization of libxl structures (including /libxl tree) elsewhere.
Backend might also remove the device info from its backend xenstore
subtree on its own.
If such situation is detected, do not fail the removal, but finish the
cleanup on frontend side.
This is just workaround, the real fix should watch when the device
backend is removed (including backend domain destruction) and remove
frontend at that time. And report such event to higher layer code, so
for example libvirt could synchronize its state.
