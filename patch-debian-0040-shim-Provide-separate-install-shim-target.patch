Subject: shim: Provide separate install-shim target

When building on a 32-bit userland, the user wants to build 32-bit
tools and a 64-bit hypervisor.  This involves setting XEN_TARGET_ARCH
to different values for the tools build and the hypervisor build.

So the user must invoke the tools build and the hypervisor build
separately.

However, although the shim is done by the tools/firmware Makefile, its
bitness needs to be the same as the hypervisor, not the same as the
tools.  When run with XEN_TARGET_ARCH=x86_32, it it skipped, which is
wrong.

So the user must invoke the shim build separately.  This can be done
with
   make -C tools/firmware/xen-dir XEN_TARGET_ARCH=x86_64

However, tools/firmware/xen-dir has no `install' target.  The
installation of all `firmware' is done in tools/firmware/Makefile.  It
might be possible to fix this, but it is not trivial.  For example,
the definitions of INST_DIR and DEBG_DIR would need to be copied, as
would an appropriate $(INSTALL_DIR) call.

For now, provide an `install-shim' target in tools/firmware/Makefile.

This has to be called from `install' of course.  We can't make it
a dependency of `install' because it might be run before `all' has
completed.  We could make it depend on a `shim' target but such
a target is nearly impossible to write because everything is done by
the inflexible subdir-$@ machinery.

The overally result of this patch is that existing make invocations
work as before.  But additionally, the user can say
  make -C tools/firmware install-shim XEN_TARGET_ARCH=x86_64
to install the shim.  The user must have built it already.
Unlike the build rune, this install-rune is properly conditional
so it is OK to call on ARM.

What a mess.
