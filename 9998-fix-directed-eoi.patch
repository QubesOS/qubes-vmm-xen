Subject: [PATCH v4] x86/io-apic: fix directed EOI when using AMD-Vi interrupt remapping
Date: Thu, 31 Oct 2024 09:57:13 +0100

When using AMD-Vi interrupt remapping the vector field in the IO-APIC RTE is
repurposed to contain part of the offset into the remapping table.  Previous to
2ca9fbd739b8 Xen had logic so that the offset into the interrupt remapping
table would match the vector.  Such logic was mandatory for end of interrupt to
work, since the vector field (even when not containing a vector) is used by the
IO-APIC to find for which pin the EOI must be performed.

A simple solution wold be to read the IO-APIC RTE each time an EOI is to be
performed, so the raw value of the vector field can be obtained.  However
that's likely to perform poorly.  Instead introduce a cache to store the
EOI handles when using interrupt remapping, so that the IO-APIC driver can
translate pins into EOI handles without having to read the IO-APIC RTE entry.
Note that to simplify the logic such cache is used unconditionally when
interrupt remapping is enabled, even if strictly it would only be required
for AMD-Vi.

Changes since v3:
 - Remove the usage of a sentinel value (again).
 - Allocate an initialize the cache in enable_IO_APIC().
 - Fix MISRA compliance.
 - Use xvmalloc.

Changes since v2:
 - Restore sentinel value.

Changes since v1:
 - s/apic_pin_eoi/io_apic_pin_eoi/.
 - Expand comment about io_apic_pin_eoi usage and layout.
 - Use uint8_t instead of unsigned int as array type.
 - Do not use a sentinel value.
