Subject: [PATCH] x86/time: prevent overflow with high frequency TSCs

Make sure tsc_khz is promoted to a 64-bit type before multiplying by
1000 to avoid an 'overflow before widen' bug. Otherwise just above
4.294GHz the value will overflow. Processors with clocks this high are
now in production and require this to work correctly.
