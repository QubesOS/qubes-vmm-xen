= About Qubes VMM Xen =

Virtualisation in Qubes is performed by Xen. Xen project creates a virtual
machine monitor also knows as hypervisor.

Several Xen libraries are required for Qubes. The ''xenstore'' commands should
work before anything else. For this, Qubes git can be used as several patches
are present impacting activity inside a VM. Say for ''archlinux'' the PKGBUILD
file is present in the ''vmm-xen'' repository. After the package is succesffuly
compiled and installed you should setup XEN filesystem.

Find more information about [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/disposablevm/ xenstore
and DisposableVM].
