Subject: [PATCH 20/35] x86/boot: Adjust MSR_ARCH_CAPS handling for the Host
 policy

We are about to move MSR_ARCH_CAPS into featureset, but the order of
operations (copy raw policy, then copy x86_capabilitiles[] in) will end up
clobbering the ARCH_CAPS value.

Some toolstacks use this information to handle TSX compatibility across the
CPUs and microcode versions where support was removed.

To avoid this transient breakage, read from raw_cpu_policy rather than
modifying it in place.  This logic will be removed entirely in due course.
