Subject: [PATCH] x86/x2apic: introduce a mixed physical/cluster mode
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The current implementation of x2APIC requires to either use Cluster Logical or
Physical mode for all interrupts.  However the selection of Physical vs Logical
is not done at APIC setup, an APIC can be addressed both in Physical or Logical
destination modes concurrently.

Introduce a new x2APIC mode called Mixed, which uses Logical Cluster mode for
IPIs, and Physical mode for external interrupts, thus attempting to use the
best method for each interrupt type.

Using Physical mode for external interrupts allows more vectors to be used, and
interrupt balancing to be more accurate.

Using Logical Cluster mode for IPIs allows fewer accesses to the ICR register
when sending those, as multiple CPUs can be targeted with a single ICR register
write.

A simple test calling flush_tlb_all() 10000 times on a tight loop on AMD EPYC
9754 with 512 CPUs gives the following figures in nano seconds:

x mixed
+ phys
* cluster
    N           Min           Max        Median           Avg        Stddev
x  25 3.5131328e+08 3.5716441e+08 3.5410987e+08 3.5432659e+08     1566737.4

Difference at 95.0% confidence
	8.81472e+08 +/- 1.46849e+06
	248.774% +/- 0.96566%
	(Student's t, pooled s = 2.05985e+06)
*  11 3.5099276e+08 3.5561459e+08 3.5461234e+08 3.5415668e+08     1415071.9
No difference proven at 95.0% confidence

So Mixed has no difference when compared to Cluster mode, and Physical mode is
248% slower when compared to either Mixed or Cluster modes with a 95%
confidence.

Note that Xen uses Cluster mode by default, and hence is already using the
fastest way for IPI delivery at the cost of reducing the amount of vectors
available system-wide.

Make the newly introduced mode the default one.

Note the printing of the APIC addressing mode done in connect_bsp_APIC() has
been removed, as with the newly introduced mixed mode this would require more
fine grained printing, or else would be incorrect.  The addressing mode can
already be derived from the APIC driver in use, which is printed by different
helpers.
