Subject: [PATCH 1/2] x86/msi: passthrough all MSI-X vector ctrl writes to
 device model
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

QEMU needs to know whether clearing maskbit of a vector is really
clearing, or was already cleared before. Currently Xen sends only
clearing that bit to the device model, but not setting it, so QEMU
cannot detect it. Because of that, QEMU is working this around by
checking via /dev/mem, but that isn't the proper approach.

Give all necessary information to QEMU by passing all ctrl writes,
including masking a vector. Advertise the new behavior via
XENVER_get_features, so QEMU can know it doesn't need to access /dev/mem
anymore.

While this commit doesn't move the whole maskbit handling to QEMU (as
discussed on xen-devel as one of the possibilities), it is a necessary
first step anyway. Including telling QEMU it will get all the required
information to do so. The actual implementation would need to include:
 - a hypercall for QEMU to control just maskbit (without (re)binding the
   interrupt again
 - a methor for QEMU to tell Xen it will actually do the work
Those are not part of this series.

I did not added any control to enable/disable this new behavior (as
Roget have suggested for possible non-QEMU ioreqs). And especially not
as part of XEN_DMOP_get_ioreq_server_info, as the behavior isn't really
per-ioreq-server but at best per-device (or system-wide, as it's
currently done). I don't see how the new behavior could be problematic
for some existing ioreq server (they already received writes to those
addresses, just not all of them), but if that's really necessary, I can
probably add a command line option to restore previous behavior
system-wide.

Changes in v4:
- ignore unaligned writes with X86EMUL_OKAY
- restructure the code to forward all writes in _msixtbl_write() instead
  of manipulating return value of msixtbl_write() - this makes
  WRITE_LEN4_COMPLETION special case unnecessary
- advertise the changed behavior via XENVER_get_features instead of DMOP
v3:
 - advertise changed behavior in XEN_DMOP_get_ioreq_server_info - make
   "flags" parameter IN/OUT
 - move len check back to msixtbl_write() - will be needed there anyway
   in a later patch
v2:
 - passthrough quad writes to emulator too (Jan)
 - (ab)use len==0 for write len=4 completion (Jan), but add descriptive
   #define for this magic value
